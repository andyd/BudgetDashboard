# Budget Comparison Lists - Research (January 2025)

## Design Criteria

### LIST 1: Budget Spending Items

- **Debatable** - Items people might question
- **Scale variety** - $10M minimum, up to $1T+

### LIST 2: Comparison Units (Alternative Spending)

- **Universally understood** - Things everyone knows the value of
- **Emotionally resonant** - Things that tug at people
- **Personal scale** - What one person/family experiences
